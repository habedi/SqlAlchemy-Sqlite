# SqlAlchemy-Sqlite
Some codes for how to use SqlAlchemy to map the data into few database shards;
There are 9 csv files [D4.csv ... D12.csv] that each one contains the data of one Bundesliga one season
from season 2004 to 2012.

the idea is to load and store these records into few(3 actually) distict 
sqlite databases using SqlAlchemy then issuing some queries over the stored data.

thought the code would benefit someone who's trying to learn SqlAlchemy for the first time, or at least for people who want to learn Database fragmentation somehow!.
