# SqlAlchemy-Sqlite
some codes for how to use sqlalchemy to map the data into few database shards.

there are 9 csv file [D4.csv ... D12.csv] that each one stands for data of one Bundesliga one season
from season 2004 to 2012; the idea is to load and store these rcords in few(3 actually) distict 
sqlite databases using SqlAlchemy then issuing some queries over the data; thought the code would benefit
someone who's trying to learn SqlAlchemy for the first time for wants to learn Database fraqmentation somehow!
